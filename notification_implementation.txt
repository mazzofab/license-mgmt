# Nextcloud Notification Feature for Driver License Management

## Overview

I've added Nextcloud bell notifications for license expiry alerts. This feature sends notifications directly to the Nextcloud UI when a driver's license is about to expire, in addition to the existing email notifications.

## Components Added

1. **Notification Manager** (`lib/Notification/NotificationManager.php`)
   - Responsible for creating and sending Nextcloud notifications
   - Provides methods to send expiry notifications and mark them as processed

2. **Notification Provider** (`lib/Notification/NotificationProvider.php`)
   - Formats notifications for display in the Nextcloud UI
   - Defines notification titles, messages, and links

3. **Updated ReminderService** (`lib/Service/ReminderService.php`)
   - Now sends both email and Nextcloud notifications
   - Tracks notification success/failure

4. **Test Controller and Route** (`lib/Controller/TestController.php`)
   - Provides an API endpoint to manually trigger notifications for testing
   - Accessible via a new button in the drivers list

5. **Updated Application Class** (`lib/AppInfo/Application.php`)
   - Registers the notification provider with Nextcloud

6. **Test Script** (`test-notification.php`)
   - Command-line script for testing notifications

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Notifications**:
   - The background job checks for licenses expiring in 30, 7, or 1 days
   - Sends Nextcloud notifications to the driver's user account
   - Still sends email notifications to configured recipients

2. **Notification Display**:
   - Notifications appear in the Nextcloud bell icon
   - Each notification includes:
     - Driver name and license number
     - Days remaining until expiry
     - Link to the drivers page

3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Use the "Test Notification" button (bell icon) next to each driver in the list
   - Run the test script from command line: `php test-notification.php <driver_id> <days_before>`

## Implementation Details

- Uses Nextcloud's built-in notification system via `IManager` and `INotifier`
- Notifications are user-specific (sent to the user who owns the driver record)
- Provides different messages based on how soon the license expires

## Testing

1. **UI Test**:
   - Click the bell icon button next to any driver in the list
   - Check the Nextcloud notification bell in the top bar

2. **Command-line Test**:
   - Run `php /path/to/nextcloud/apps/driverlicensemgmt/test-notification.php 1 7`
   - Replace "1" with the driver ID and "7" with days before expiry

3. **Cron Job Test**:
   - Run `sudo -u www-data php /path/to/nextcloud/occ background:execute`
   - This will process all pending background jobs, including license notifications
