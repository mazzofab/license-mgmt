## Key Features

- Track drivers with their license information
- Manage notification recipients
- Send automated reminders at 30, 7, and 1 day before license expiry
- User-friendly interface that integrates with Nextcloud's design

## Core Components

## Integration with Nextcloud

The app integrates with several Nextcloud components:

1. **Navigation** - App appears in the main navigation menu
2. **Database** - Uses Nextcloud's database abstraction layer
3. **Background Jobs** - Leverages Nextcloud's background job system for reminders
4. **Notifications** - Uses Nextcloud's notification system for user feedback
5. **Styling** - Follows Nextcloud's design patterns and color scheme

## Workflow

1. Administrators add drivers and their license information
2. Administrators configure notification recipients
3. The app automatically sends reminders when licenses are about to expire
4. Administrators can track, update, and manage all data through the web interface
